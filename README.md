BugTracktor is a bug tracking software made using **NodeJS**. Users can sign up and add bugs that show up during development and assign them to other users to work on. It has the ability to host multiple projects, each project containing its own bugs.

The database used was MongoDB with the help of Mongoose ❤️. The database is deployed on a live **MongoDB Atlas** server which intern hosts the database on **AWS**. The app itself is deployed on **Heroku**.
