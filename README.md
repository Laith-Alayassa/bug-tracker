BugTracktor is a bug tracking software made using **NodeJS**. Users can sign up and add bugs that show up during development and assign them to other users to work on. It has the ability to host multiple projects, each project containing its own bugs.

The database used was MongoDB with the help of Mongoose ‚ù§Ô∏è. The database is deployed on a live **MongoDB Atlas** server which intern hosts the database on **AWS**. The app itself is deployed on **Heroku**.

## üí™ <strong> I used this app to track the bugs that I have faced while coding it</strong>

# üß† Things I Learned...
### [From never using to deploying in 10 days]
| MongoDB                 | JS | DOM & EJS                  | Heroku                      | Bootstrap              | Git |   API* |
| -------------           | --- | -------------------------| ---------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---- |------ |
| NoSQL databases         | Express | Document object model | Deploying Nodejs to Heroku  | Using built-in classes |  Using branches    | HTTP and RESTful |
| Mongoose + Atlas cloud  | NodeJS  | Embedded JS templates | Deploying with cloud DB | Using Bootstrap themes        |  Working with multiple repos (GitHub + Heroku)   | using PostMan |

I had no experience with all of the above technologies, but I learned them and built the app in 10 days.

# üßê What would I do differently:
- Work on having Heroic working as soon as possible in the process to catch errors early and easy
- Start with a cloud database instead of switching from local to catch errors early and easy
- Add branches to my workflow
- Spend time setting up proper links for CSS/JS files in BootStrap theme to work seamlessly across all pages

# üîß Problems I faced:
- Deploying Error on Heroic -> Heroku couldn't access the cloud database
- Loading JS/CSS for pages with multiple directories in their path (.com/directory1/directory2)




&ast; While I did not eventually use APIs for this program, I researched and learned how to use them, and built the famous weather app as a part of learning to create this program. Adding an API to retrieve bugs could be a possible next step.
